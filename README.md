# Hey! I'm Zain ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced software engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the gaming, fashion, and healthcare industries. Programming has always been a hobby of mine, but recently it has become a more significant part of my life. I'm extremely proud of my accomplishments so far, and am motivated to keep the momentum going by learning from and helping like-minded individuals.
