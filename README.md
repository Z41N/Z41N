# Hey! I'm Zain ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced software engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the e-commerce, advertising, gaming, fashion, and healthcare industries. 
Programming plays a significant role in my life, and it's something I deeply enjoy both professionally and leisurely. 
Looking forward to building cool things and making some friends along the way!
